# project-1-mortality
Machine learning analysis of NHANES 1999–2000 data to predict mortality using KNN models.

## Project Organization
The Google Colab notebook is organized accordingly: 

- The **answers to Part 1 questions** are provided in the **first markdown cell** of the notebook.
- This is followed by the **code for Part 1**, including data wrangling, merging datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.
- The notebook then proceeds to **Part 2**, where model development and evaluation are presented.
- For Part 2, **code cells are followed by markdown explanations and answers** discussing model results, interpretation, and limitations.
